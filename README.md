Maze solver made in python

Maze image rules:
1. Maze entries must be top to bottom (to be changed)
2. Maze walls and path must be 1 pixel wide
2. Walkable path in maze must be white (rgb(255,255,255)) and walls black (rgb(0,0,0))

Use instructions:
1. Download and install all needed depencies (opencv-python)
2. Run mazesolver.py with maze image as a command line argument (For e.g: "py mazeSolver.py maze.png")
3. Maze image is cloned including correct path marked with red color to the same file path as the original maze image. (solved maze is named image.png)
